prerender-mongodb-cache
=======================

Prerender plugin for MongoDB caching, to be used with the prerender node application from https://github.com/prerender/prerender.

How it works
------------

This plugin will store all prerendered pages into a MongoDB instance. There is currently no expiration functionality, which means that once a page is stored, future requests for prerendering a page will always be served from from the database cache if it's available and the page caches are never updated.

To get a fresh cache, you will have to delete the cache in the MongoDB instance manually or from another process.

How to use
----------

In your local prerender project run:

    $ npm install prerender-mongodb-cache --save
    
Then in the server.js that initializes the prerender:

    server.use(require('prerender-mongodb-cache'));

Configuration
-------------

By default it will connect to your MongoDB instance running on localhost and use the *prerender* collection. You can overwrite this by setting the `MONGO_URL` (or `MONGOLAB_URI` or `MONGOHQ_URL`) environment variable to valid MongoDB connection strings.

The collection name can be controlled with `MONGO_CACHE_COLLECTION` environment variable.

This is done to make it work automatically when deployed on Heroku with the MongoDB add-ons.
